## (a) Draw DFDs up to appropriate levels for the RRS.
DFD is the abbreviation for Data Flow Diagram. The flow of data of a system or a process is represented by a DFD. It also gives insight into the inputs and outputs of each entity and the process itself. DFD does not have control flow, and no loops or decision rules are present. Specific operations depending on the type of data can be explained by a flowchart.

0-level, 1-level, and 2-level DFD for the RRS are given below:

0-level DFD    

1-level DFD

2-level DFD


## (b) Draw ERDs for the RRS. Describe the relationships between different Entities. 

Entity Relationship Diagram: ERD is a graphical representation that depicts relationships among people, objects, places, concepts, or events within an information technology (IT) system.

## (c) Design Data Dictionary for RRS.
The Data Dictionary consists of database metadata. It has records about objects in the database.
