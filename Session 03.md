## Session 3: Develop SRS (Software Requirements Specification) for the Railway Reservation System (RRS).

Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the railway reservation system, I’ll create a structured document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, system scope, and constraints. The SRS will build on the previously provided scope and technical approach, ensuring clarity for stakeholders (developers, testers, railway authorities, and end-users). The document will follow the IEEE 29148 standard for SRS, adapted for conciseness while maintaining comprehensiveness. Below is the SRS for the railway reservation system.

## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
    This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Railway Reservation System (RRS), a software solution to manage train ticket bookings, cancellations, train schedules, and related services. The document serves as a contract between stakeholders (railway authorities, developers, and end-users) to ensure the system meets operational and user needs.

## 1.2 Scope
    The Railway Reservation System (RRS) is a centralized platform to facilitate ticket reservations, cancellations, fare calculations, and train schedule management for passengers and railway administrators. Key features include:

        User registration, login, and profile management.
        Train search, seat selection, and ticket booking (confirmed, waitlisted, RAC).
        Secure payment processing and refund handling.
        Real-time train status and seat availability updates.
        Administrative functions for trains and scheduling management.
        Multi-platform access via web, mobile, and desktop applications.
        Reporting for operational insights (e.g., revenue, occupancy).
        The system will integrate with external services (e.g., payment gateways, train tracking APIs) and comply with railway regulations. It excludes train operations (e.g., signaling) and onboard services (e.g., catering).

## 2. Overall Description

## 2.1 Product Perspective
    The RRS is a standalone system with interfaces to external services (e.g., payment gateways, train tracking APIs). It replaces manual or legacy ticketing systems, providing a scalable, user-friendly platform for passengers and railway staff. The system operates in a distributed environment, leveraging cloud infrastructure for high availability and real-time updates.

    System Interfaces:

        User Interfaces: Web portal, mobile app (iOS/Android), desktop app for ticket counters.
        External Interfaces: Payment gateways (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe), SMS/email services, train tracking APIs.
        Hardware Interfaces: Standard servers, mobile devices, and ticket counter terminals.
        Software Interfaces: Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), caching (Redis), cloud services (AWS).

## 2.2 Product Functions
    The RRS provides the following major functions:
        User Management: Register, authenticate, and manage passenger/admin profiles.
        Train Management: Add, update, and remove train schedules and configurations.
        Booking Management: Search trains, select seats, book tickets, and generate PNRs.
        Payment Processing: Calculate fares, process payments, and issue refunds.
        Real-Time Updates: Provide train status, seat availability, and booking notifications.
        Reporting: Generate reports on bookings, revenue, and occupancy.
        Multi-Platform Access: Support web, mobile, and desktop interfaces.

## 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
    Passengers:
        General public, varying technical proficiency.
        Need intuitive UI for searching, booking, and managing tickets.
        Access via web or mobile app.
    Ticket Counter Staff:
        Railway employees with basic computer skills.
        Use desktop app for offline/online ticketing.
        Require fast transaction processing.
    Administrators:
        Railway officials with technical training.
        Manage train schedules, monitor operations, and generate reports.
        Access via secure admin portal.
    System Administrators:
        IT staff managing system maintenance, backups, and security.
        Require access to logs and configuration settings.

## 2.4 Operating Environment

    Hardware: Cloud servers (e.g., AWS EC2), mobile devices (iOS 14+, Android 10+), desktop terminals (Windows 10+).
    Software: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), mobile apps, Java-based desktop app.
    Network: Reliable internet for online operations; offline support for ticket counters.
    Database: PostgreSQL (transactional data), MongoDB (logs), Redis (caching).
    Cloud: AWS for hosting, Kubernetes for orchestration.

## 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
    Regulatory Compliance: Adhere to railway policies (e.g., refund rules, fare structures) and data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA).
    Scalability: Handle peak loads (e.g., 1 million concurrent users during festivals).
    Interoperability: Integrate with existing railway systems (e.g., train tracking APIs).
    Multilingual Support: Support English and regional languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil).
    Technology Stack: Use Java (Spring Boot) for backend, React.js/Flutter for frontend, and AWS for cloud.

## 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
    Assumptions:
        Stable internet connectivity for online users.
        Railway policies (e.g., fare rules) are provided by the client.
        Users have basic familiarity with web/mobile interfaces.
    Dependencies:
        Availability of external APIs (e.g., payment gateways, train tracking).
